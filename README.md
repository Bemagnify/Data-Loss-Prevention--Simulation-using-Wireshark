# Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Simulation using Wireshark

## Project Objective
Simulate Data Loss Prevention (DLP) by using Wireshark to capture and detect sensitive data in network traffic.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Test Environment (Localhost or browser search)

## Steps Performed
1. Captured network traffic.
2. Simulated sensitive data input.
3. Applied Wireshark filters to detect sensitive keywords.
4. Analyzed and documented findings.
5. Provided security recommendations.

## Results
Captured sensitive data in plaintext using Wireshark filters.

## Recommendation
Implement HTTPS, encryption, and DLP tools for data protection.
